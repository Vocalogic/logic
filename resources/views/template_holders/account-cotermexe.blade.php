Your quote has been executed and has replaced your existing agreement with {setting.brand-name}.

Your new services have been attached and your contract date was not extended or altered. This is commonly understood as a 'co-termed' agreement that supplements your existing agreement.

If you have any questions please feel free to respond to this email; otherwise we are actively working on adjusting your services.

If any additional products have been ordered, you will see an immediate invoice for said products, otherwise your new service billing will be reflected during your next billing cycle.
