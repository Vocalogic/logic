**Logic** is an open source project started by Chris Horne ([@devhorne](https://www.twitter.com/devhorne)), initially to
manage the day to day business process for [Vocalogic](https://www.vocalogic.com), A business telephone/VOIP Provider in
Atlanta, GA.

We wanted potential customers to be able to browse a shop, pick products and services, generate a quote and either
download the quote or start services completely unassisted. We also needed flexible automated billing, financing
options, contract signing and more. Vocal (the phone side) and Logic (the business process) prides itself
on efficiency for admins to perform tasks, and customer experience for the end user.
